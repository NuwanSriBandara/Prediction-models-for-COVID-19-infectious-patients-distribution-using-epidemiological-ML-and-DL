# SLIIT_Datathon_2020

In this project, an anlysis was attempted in order to predict the number of infected people in Sri Lanka as per the effect of on-going COVID-19 pandemic. The predictive model analysis was intuitively developed and tested using several different approaches: traditional machine learning models, enhanced epidemiological models with machine learning and advanced deep learing techniques such as convolutional neural networks.
